== ianblenke/mock-s3

For local development, [mock-s3](https://github.com/jserver/mock-s3) makes for a useful tiny S3 service.

This is the [ianblenke/mock-s3](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/ianblenke/mock-s3/) autobuild docker image from the github repo [ianblenke/docker-mock-s3](https://github.com/ianblenke/docker-mock-s3)

This image is a major refactoring based on the docker [cnry/mock-s3](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cnry/mock-s3/) image to allow for auto-creation of buckets on startup.

It's also a good example of a very simple supervisord based docker container.
